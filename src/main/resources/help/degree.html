		<em><b>Degree of a Node</b></em><br><br>
		<p>Degree of a node is defined as the number of nodes adjacent to the given node, where "adjacent" means directly connected. The nodes directly connected 
		to the given node are also called as "first neighbors" of the given node. Thus, the degree also corresponds to the number of adjacent incident edges.</p>
		<br><em><b>In-degree and Out-degree of a Node</b></em><br><br>
		<p>In directed networks we have in-degree as well as out-degree. In-degree of a node is the total number of edges which target the given node, 
		whereas out-degree is the total number of edges which point from the given to its adjacent nodes.</p>
		<p>In the case of a dynamic network degree(in-degree and out-degree in the case of a directed dynamic network) for each node is calculated for every 
		time interval for which the adjaceny matrix remains the same. </p>
