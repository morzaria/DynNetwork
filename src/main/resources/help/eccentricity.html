max{dist(v,w) : w  N}<br>The eccentricity is a node centrality index. The eccentricity of a node v is calculated by
computing the shortest path between the node v and all other nodes in the graph, then the
“longest” shortest path is chosen (let (v, K) where K is the most distant node from v). Once
this path with length dist(v, K) is identified, its reciprocal is calculated (1/dist(v, K)). By
doing that, an eccentricity with higher value assumes a positive meaning in term of node
proximity.</p>
