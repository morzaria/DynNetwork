		<em><b>Betweenness</b></em><br><br>
		<p>The S.-P. Betweenness is a node centrality index. It is similar to the stress but 
		provides a more elaborated and informative centrality index. The betweenness of a node n is 
		calculated considering couples of nodes (v1, v2) and counting the number of shortest paths linking v1
		and v2 and passing through a node n. Then, the value is related to the total number of shortest
		paths linking v1 and v2. Thus, a node can be traversed by only one path linking v1 and v2,
		but if this path is the only connecting v1 and v2 the node n will score a higher betweenness
		value (in the stress computation would have had a low score). Thus, a high S.-P. Betweenness
		score means that the node, for certain paths, is crucial to maintain node connections. Notably,
		to know the number of paths for which the node is critical it is necessary to look at the
		stress. Thus, stress and S.-P. Betweenness can be used to gain complementary information.
		Further information could be gained by referring the S.-P. Betweenness to node couples, thus
		“quantifying” the importance of a node for two connected nodes.
