		<em><b>Dynamic Graph Metrics</b></em><br><br>
		To help you analyze a dynamic network and determine the relative importance of a vertex within a dynamic network, we 
		provide you with the following measures of centrality that are widely used in network analysis:<br><br>
		1. Degree(Indegree and Out degree for directed networks)<br>
		2. Closenness<br>
		3. Radiality<br>
		4. Stress<br>
		5. Betweenness<br>
		6. Centroid<br>
		7. Eigenvector.<br><br>
		In addition to the above measures of centrality, we provide you with:<br>
		1. Diameter<br>
		2. Average Distance<br>
		to get a general overview about the network.
